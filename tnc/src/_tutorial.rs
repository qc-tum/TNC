//! # Tutorial
//!
//! Here you will find explanations and instructions on various topics related to the
//! library. If you are missing something, feel free to open an issue.
//!
//! Please note that we only include code examples here when necessary, as doc tests
//! are unfortunately only executed for code examples in function docstrings (and not
//! module docstrings). Accordingly, code examples in the tutorials are not executed
//! and therefore run the risk of quickly becoming outdated.
